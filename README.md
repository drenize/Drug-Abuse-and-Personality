# Drug Abuse and Personality Traits

**Objective**

This project aims at unravelling the relationship between personality traits and drug consumption.
First, the normalized data is coded into more apprehensible, numeric categories. 
Then further features are engineered to highlight deeper data structures. The engineered variables are: soft drug consumption, hard drug consumption, legal drug consumption, illegal drug consumption, synthetic and nonsynthetic drug consumption, recent consumtion, hard score and hardliners.

The hard score (hard_score) is build of the mean of neuroticism, extraversion, impulsiveness and sensation seeking. The hardliner variable, however, comprises only the 10% highest hard scores. 

**Business Case**

A drug prevention organization is interested in the use frequency of illegal drugs of hardliner personalities versus other people. Furthermore, they want to predict the use of illegal drugs.
